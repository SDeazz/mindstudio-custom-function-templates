# MindStudio Custom Function Templates

## Introduction
Welcome to the MindStudio Custom Function Template repository, where developers contribute JavaScript functions specifically designed for non-technical people to use inside MindStudio. This repository is a hub where creativity meets functionality, enabling users to extend the capabilities of the MindStudio platform with custom JavaScript functions.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Development Guidelines
1. **Function Requirements**: Each JavaScript function should be self-contained, well-commented, and adhere to standard coding practices. Ensure your function is tested and works seamlessly within MindStudio.
3. **Single-Purpose**: Don't try to do too much inside a single function. Do one thing and do it well. This will help others to use your function effectively within their own apps.
4. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for your functions and variables. Avoid abbreviations and overly complex terminology.
5. **API Keys**: If your function relies on third-party APIs that require API keys, include instructions to help users register for those services and find their keys.

### Submitting Your Contribution
1. **Create a New Branch**: For each new function, create a separate branch in your forked repository.
2. **Commit Your Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch and commit them with a clear message describing the addition or change.
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your function is ready, create a pull request to the main repository. Ensure the PR title and description clearly state the purpose and functionality of your contribution.
4. **Code Review**: Your PR will be reviewed by the community. Be open to suggestions and required changes.
5. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository, making your function available to the community.

### Pull Request Review Process
- **Code Quality**: Ensure your code is well-written, efficient, and follows best practices.
- **Functionality**: The function should work as intended without causing any issues in MindStudio.
- **Documentation**: Proper documentation for understanding and implementing the function is essential.
- **Community Standards**: Respect the community while interacting and contributing.
